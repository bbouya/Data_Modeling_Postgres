# Data_Modeling_Postgres

## Introduction

A startup wants to analyse the data  they have been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app.
The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs user are listening to. 
Currently, they dont have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of json logs on user activity on the app

## Project Description
In this project, we will apply archetecture of data modeling with postgres and build a ELT Pipeline Using python.

## Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID.
